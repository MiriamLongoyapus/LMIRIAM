<h1 style="color: black;">My experience At AkiraChix</h1>
<body>
    <p>My first week at AkiraChix was good because i was welcomed by the alumna very nicely. They 
        were so  welcoming and the rooms were well arranged and clean. The school was also clean
         not to mention how the classes were arranged. The environment was well conducive for learning 
         since there is no noise that  causes distraction.
